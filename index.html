        <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br>
                    They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. <br>
                    This is most unfortunate.” <br>
                    The farmer said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.<br>
                    What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”<br>
                    The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.<br> 
                    The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="Bad">Bad</p></span>,” and the farmer responded, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br> 
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br> 
                    Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="Good">Good</span> or <span class="Bad">Bad</span><br>
                    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="Good">Good</span> fortune.

                        <span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective.<br>
                        Bananas are <span class="Good">Good<span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="Good">Good</span> for bananas. <br>
                        Let's not make a big deal out of it...<br>
